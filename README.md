## 📘 Overview

**Dataset summary:**  
**Rows:** 2,000 | **Columns:** 21 | **Missing Values:** 0  

This dataset provides a **clean and well-structured view** of major **cancer risk factors** at the patient level.  
Each record represents an individual described through **lifestyle**, **environmental**, and **genetic** indicators associated with cancer development.


It is ideal for:
- Educational use in **data science, EDA, and ML pipelines**  
- Testing **classification algorithms** (e.g., predict `Cancer_Type` or `Risk_Level`)  
- Demonstrating **data cleaning, feature importance, and leakage detection**

## 🧪 Data Insights

- No missing or duplicate values  
- Balanced representation across five cancer types: Breast, Lung, Colon, Skin, and Prostate  
- Variables scaled on a **0–10 risk intensity** system  
- `Overall_Risk_Score` and `Risk_Level` are **derived features** — exclude from training if predicting risk
